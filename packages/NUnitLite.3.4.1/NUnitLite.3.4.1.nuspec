    <description>NUnitLite provides a simple way to run NUnit tests, without the overhead of a full NUnit installation. It is suitable for projects that want to have a quick way to run tests using a console runner and don't need all the features of the NUnit engine and console runner.

Supported platforms:
- .NET 2.0+
- .NET Core (Universal Windows Apps 10+, DNX Core 5+)
- Portable Libraries (supporting Profile259)
        
How to use this package:

1. Create a console application for your tests and delete the generated class containing Main().
2. Install the NUnitLite package, which creates a new Main() as well as adding a reference to NUnitLite. This will also bring in the NUnit package, which adds a reference to the nunit framework to your project.
3. Add your tests to the test project and simply start the project to execute them.</description>
